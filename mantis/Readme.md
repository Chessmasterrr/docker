Mantis Bug Tracker is a free and open source, web-based bug tracking system.

The Dockerfile contains a mantis installation with the CustomReporter plugin (currently downloaded from my own fork, until support for the newest version is in the master branch of the plugin). The Dockerfile has detailed comments to be as transparent as possible.
